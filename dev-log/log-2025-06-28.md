# Start of the quire project

A minimal version of a bug tracking system.

### Tech stack and tools
- React with vite (node v22)
- Spring Boot with Maven (Jdk 24)
- DB is currently in memory H2, will replace with a MySQL instance
- Using ChatGPT, Google Search and Gemini 2.5 Pro Cli agent tool
- Git & Github for version control and hosting respectively
- Haven't created the design doc yet (just wanted to start and not think much)
- Intend to deploy on a VPS

### What happened today?
- Create an Issue representation. Issue can be of different types.
A Task, A Bug, A Story/Feature etc. Which is the core of the system.
- Gave gemini cli to create a react project with tailwind css (which I have zero idea about btw), 
and described what the Issue component should be.
- Struggled to setup as there are permission issues initially.
- So I asked Gemini to just write the code, then I will run the commands with sudo.
- Dependency issue arrived. Something related to postfixcss and tailwind. Vite throwing error.
- **Learning**: Better to understand your build system of your project, need to read some documentation
and setup the inital project myself and then ask the AI to write the code.
- As for the Spring Boot api, which I'm familiar with I just generated the initial project at
<https://start.spring.io> with the necessary dependencies.
- Although DB is not setup yet, currently using H2.
- Need to follow incremental design and need to shape the project as we go.
